Push #7 Notes:
- started bidirectional variants 

Push #6 Notes:
- finished CNN + LSTM model
- reorganized training loops

Push #5 Notes:
- started CNN + LSTM model (issues with the dimension size of data)
- reorganized some data between models to base class 

Push #4 Notes:
- finished autoregression for the LSTM
- added testing function for LSTM
- added some documentation for the helper.py class
- consider to change output layer from ReLu to Sigmoid

Push #3 Notes:
- finished basic LSTM class with forward propagation and final linear layer
- added training loop in LSTM.py
- added helpers.py for some basic data manipulation functions such as a heat correlation map printing function, dataset loading function, and dataset class.
- started autoregression version of LSTM
- added a test.py for testing and experiment with different models

Push #2 Notes:
- added the gitignore and removed all big csv and txt files
- added data cleaning file
- started LSTM class for SOH prediction

Push #1 Notes:
- added project structure (separate SOH and backtesting directory)
- added some boilerplate code for the back testing found in test.py
- added requirements.txt
